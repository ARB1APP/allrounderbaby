            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Allrounder Baby values customer insights and strives to enhance its programs based on real-world user experiences. To encourage meaningful feedback, the Company provides cashback incentives to eligible users who submit comprehensive feedback. Users must have completed at least one full course on the platform to qualify, and the feedback must be detailed, genuine, and constructive, covering aspects such as content quality, usability, and observed impact on child development. The Company reserves the right to specify the format of the feedback, which may include written testimonials, audio recordings, or video submissions. The feedback may be used for promotional and research purposes, and by participating in the cashback program, the user consents to such use. Cashback is granted only once per user per course, and multiple claims for the same course will not be accepted.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Eligible users will receive a cashback percentage of their original purchase price, the percentage and maximum cashback limit being determined at the sole discretion of the Company. Cashback will be processed within 60 days from the date of approval and will be credited to the original payment method, such as bank transfer or digital payment wallets. If the payment was made in USD or EUR, the cashback will be converted at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of processing, and any applicable foreign exchange conversion fees will be deducted. The Company will process cashback only to the bank account registered in the user's name, whether domestic or international. In case of an international payout, the user must provide complete bank details, including IBAN or SWIFT code, and ensure that their financial institution can receive international transactions. Any intermediary bank fees or deductions levied by international banking systems shall be borne by the user, and the Company will not be responsible for variations in final credited amounts due to currency fluctuations or banking charges.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their bank account details are accurate and up to date. Any changes in bank account details must be updated through the user profile or by submitting a request to support@allrounderbaby.com, along with necessary verification documents. Failure to provide accurate details may lead to delays or rejection of cashback payments, and the Company shall not be liable for payments sent to incorrect or outdated accounts due to user negligence. For users based in India, providing a valid PAN number is mandatory for cashback processing in compliance with applicable tax regulations. International users may be required to submit equivalent tax identification or banking compliance documents as per their country’s regulatory requirements. If KYC verification is required, the user must provide a valid government-issued identity proof and address verification before the cashback can be processed.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Cashback incentives will not be applicable to users who have already availed a refund for the purchased course. If the feedback is found to be incomplete, misleading, inaccurate, biased, or copied from other sources, the Company reserves the right to reject the cashback request. Any user found to be abusing the cashback system by submitting fabricated testimonials, using AI-generated content, or engaging in fraudulent activities may be permanently disqualified from all future cashback programs. The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the cashback program at any time without prior notice, and any modifications will take effect immediately upon publication. If any fraudulent activity is suspected, the Company reserves the right to withhold cashback at its sole discretion.

            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Allrounder Baby offers a referral program where existing users can earn monetary rewards by referring new customers to purchase courses or services. The Referrer must be a registered and active user with an account in good standing, and the Referred User must be a first-time customer who has never previously signed up or made a purchase on the platform. To qualify for the referral bonus, the Referred User must use the unique referral code or link provided by the Referrer at the time of registration and checkout and must complete the payment process successfully.

            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Referral earnings will be credited within 60 days after the referred user's successful and verified payment. The payout will be processed in the same currency as the original transaction, which may be INR, USD, or EUR. If the referral payment involves an international transaction, the payout will be converted at the best available foreign exchange rate at the time of processing. Any banking fees, forex conversion charges, or intermediary bank deductions applicable to international transactions will be borne by the Referrer. The minimum payout threshold may apply, and multiple referral earnings may be combined into a single payout if they do not individually meet the threshold. The Referrer must ensure that their bank account details, including SWIFT or IBAN codes for international transfers, are accurately provided and updated. The Company shall not be responsible for payments sent to incorrect or outdated accounts due to user negligence.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              To ensure compliance with financial and regulatory laws, all Referrers must complete KYC verification before withdrawal of referral earnings. For Indian users, submission of a valid PAN number is mandatory if the referral earnings exceed government-mandated tax thresholds. International users may be required to provide their tax identification number or other necessary documentation based on the regulatory requirements of their respective countries. Referral earnings will only be credited to a bank account registered in the user’s name, and no third-party accounts will be permitted. Users must ensure that their payment details remain accurate and up to date to avoid processing delays or payment rejections.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              Fraud prevention measures have been implemented to maintain the integrity of the referral program. Self-referrals, duplicate accounts, fake sign-ups, and the use of bots or temporary email addresses to generate referrals are strictly prohibited. Any Referrer found engaging in fraudulent activities or misrepresenting the referral program may face account suspension, forfeiture of earnings, or legal action. If a referral is found to be invalid, manipulated, or artificial, the payout will be withheld or revoked at the Company's discretion.
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.leadText}>
              The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the referral program at any time without prior notice. If the program is discontinued, any pending referral payouts may be canceled, and users will not be entitled to compensation. The Company reserves the sole discretion to resolve any disputes related to referral eligibility, payout amounts, or suspected fraud. Users participating in the referral program acknowledge and accept the Company's right to amend the terms of the program as necessary to comply with financial regulations, prevent misuse, and ensure fairness.
